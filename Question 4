-1st we delete VOTE pod then Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
[root@ip-172-31-42-126 ~]# kubectl get po

in frontend it works fine , there is no impact  when we delete voter pod , seemless transaction done from the old pod to new pod , in unix  old pod get deleted new vote pod created with new name but that didnt impact anything .

2nd we delete the WORKER pod  then Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix

3rd once  DB pod deletd  Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix

in front end  all data is gone , it is showing no votes yet

in unix end All the data gone and it is showing no vote in unix side worker pod and result pod restarted as there is socket connection between those pod , when db pod is deleted worker pods try to pushing the data to db worker once to write the data into database , and database is not there so he is restarting the container so that connection would be there and same for result pod db pod is pulling the data to result pod and once db pod is deleted result pod is trying to access the db pod and database is not there so it is restarting so that connection would be there between result and db pods 
once both container is restarted now they are connecting to new database
