If we have 100 nodes then it allocate 1 pods in every nodes so that cpu utilisation of every nodes is not high for rc it can not able to allocate each pods in 1 nodes 
daemon set will run on every node , it is hardware based , if nodes are 100 then daemon set automatically replicate its value as 100 and it is used to monitor the nodes
